    """
    Find number of eggs to bring back, using the smallest number of eggs. Assumes there is
    an infinite supply of eggs of each weight, and there is always a egg of value 1.

    Parameters:
    egg_weights - tuple of integers, available egg weights sorted from smallest to largest value (1 = d1 < d2 < ... < dk)
    target_weight - int, amount of weight we want to find eggs to fit
    memo - dictionary, OPTIONAL parameter for memoization (you may not need to use this parameter depending on your implementation)

    Returns: int, smallest number of eggs needed to make target weight
    """
    # Objective function is the minimum number of eggs.
    # Weight limit is the target_weight.
    # Values of each item are just ones.
    # Weights of each item are weights of eggs.
    # I really did find this problem hard because overall I am bad at recursive calls.
    # However, first constructing the three, than solving without dynamic programming was not that bad.
    # After that, I added the dynamic programming part. I recommend watcing this video:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oBt53YbR9Kk&t=214s
    # I tried to implement number of eggs for each distinct egg, I cannot make it work. Hence, I make it like a greedy algorithm

    # Problem B.2
    # QUESTION - 1
    # This is because the fact that brute force algorithm checks all possibilities.
    # QUESTION - 2 and 3
    # It can be seen above that greedy algorithm does not return the optimal solution. For example:
    # If we have 938 as target limit, a greddy algorithm selects 46 x 20 2 x 7 and 4 x 1 with a total number of 6 eggs.
    # However, optimal solution is 46 x 20 1 x 7, 2 x 5 and 1 x 1 with a total number of 4 eggs. We should check these possibilities!

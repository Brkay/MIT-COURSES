    # What difference does choosing a specific day to plot the data for versus
    # calculating the yearly average have on our graphs (i.e., in terms of the Râ2
    # values and the fit of the resulting curves)? Interpret the results.
    # ANSWER:
    # Oscillation and range of the data is decreased due to mean. R2 value is increased, which is good and expected.
    # Hence, fit of the curve is better.

    # Why do you think these graphs are so noisy? Which one is more noisy?
    # ANSWER:
    # Specific day data has more noise because daily weather conditions can heavily affect the observations.

    # How do these graphs support or contradict the claim that global warming is
    # leading to an increase in temperature? The slope and the standard
    # error-to-slope ratio could be helpful in thinking about this.
    # ANSWER:
    # As we can see from the plots, there is an increasing trend and standard error-to-slope ratio is lower for the less noisy data.

    # the Râ2â values, the fit of the resulting curves, and whether the graph
    # supports/contradicts our claim about global warming)? Interpret the
    # results.
    # ANSWER:
    # Range of the data is lower for the part b and ratiof of SE is much lower than the ones in the part a. Hence, we can conclude that,
    # fitted line represents better the data for part B. Moreover, we can see that there is positive correlation between time and temperature which supports global warming claim.

    # Why do you think this is the case?
    # ANSWER:
    # Here we are actually observing more realizations(for every city) than the part A section 2; therefore, results are more reliable.

    # How would we expect the results to differ if we used 3 different cities?
    # What about 100 different cities?
    # ANSWER:
    # As the number of cities increases, our conclusion becomes more reliable because we observe more data.

    # How would the results have changed if all 21 cities were in the same region
    # of the United States?
    # ANSWER:
    # Results become biased because only one region can lead to wrong conclusions. Also, regional changes may be much more effictive for a specific region.

    # How do these models compare to each other?
    # Degree with 20 is the best and degree with 1 is the worst one, using lots of coefficients yield better results.
    # Which one has the best R2 ? Why?
    # Degree 20 has the best R2. Reason is that data is not exactly linear so a parabolic effect has resulted in better in terms of accuracy.
    # Which model best fits the data? Why?
    # Degree with 20 because it fits the data better with lots of coefficient.

    # How did the different models perform? How did their RMSEs compare?

    # they the same as those in part D.2.I? Why?
    # As before mentioned, linear is the best. This is a great example of the overfitting. As we can see, model order 20 captures the training data best but it failed in the testing data.

    # temperature of New York City) instead of the 5-year moving average over
